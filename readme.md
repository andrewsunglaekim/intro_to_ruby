# Introduction to Ruby!!

## Greetings & Icebreakers
- name
- where you're from
- what you do
- favorite holiday and why?

## LO's
- describe the utility of computer programming
- define the role of a REPL in programming
- list 5 common data types used in ruby and their uses
- describe what variables are and what they are used for
- describe what a method is and why they are useful
- control flow

Prior Knowledge Inventory(5m)
-	list every day uses of computer programming
Take Email for example:
- *what did the programmer think about in order to write the program for email*
- data types

Metaphor of PB&J making robot(5m)
- computer programming allows us to do simple tasks efficiently
Bringing us back to ruby basics. To learn the building blocks of your first computer programming language.

### Some Data types
- strings
- integers(FIXNUM)
- floats
- booleans
- nil

- use variables within REPL(narrate 10m)
	- ask why we use variables?
	- set variable name = "andy"
	- set variable to a = "something"
	- set variable to the_number_ten = 10
	- speak briefly about naming convention and semantic naming
		- what are some things about this variable name that is good?
		- going forward we want to name things semantically, but not the extreme as the above example
		- do full_name in REPL, than draw diagram(variables/value chart)
			- first_name + last_name = full_name
